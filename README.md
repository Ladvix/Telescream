# Telescream
Telescream is a secure Telegram userbot that enables end-to-end encrypted private chats between two users. Built with cryptography in mind, it uses a hybrid encryption scheme combining RSA (asymmetric) for key exchange and AES (symmetric) for fast, secure message encryption â€” ensuring your conversations stay private and safe from eavesdropping.
